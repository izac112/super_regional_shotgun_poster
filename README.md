# super_regional_shotgun_poster
Completely useless, badly written and only on GitHub because i want to clean up my "useless scripts" folder. 

This is a little script with a gui that quickly spams out whatever string you type in to it, in discord big regional letters, meant for discord and the "delay" is how many seconds you want it to wait before spamming out the string.
